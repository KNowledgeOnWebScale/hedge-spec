# Use Case Description
	
Read access by anyone with a healthcare relationship with the patient's MoveUp patient ID over the patient's Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor pod slices. 

For that:
- The user has a [policy](policy-25.ttl) that allows his Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor slices to be read by anyone with a healthcare relationship with his MoveUp's patient ID.
- Healthcare professional issues a [request](request-25.ttl) to read the patient's pod Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor slices without time limit and with consent as legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

## Issues
### Open Issues

1. Is Data Source not applicable or is it FAQIR?

2. Would the healthcare professional be data controller or just a reader?

    If just a reader, would it be the Recipient? 

3. Is the recipient constraint `odrl:assignee ehds:HealthProfessional` enough? Should it also be stated in the request?

    Or should the relationship be declared explicitly? (Current approach)
    ```
    odrl:permission [
            ...
            odrl:assignee ex:healthcareProfessional ;
            ... ]
    odrl:constraint [
            odrl:leftOperand dpv:Recipient ;
            odrl:operator odrl:eq ;
            odrl:rightOperand ex:healthcareProfessional ]
            ... 

    ex:healthcareProfessional a ehds:HealthProfessional ;
        dpv:hasRelationWithDataSubject ex:patient .
    ```

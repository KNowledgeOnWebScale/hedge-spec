# Use Case Description

Access by physician as data controller to specific subset of data with a known URI to be refined (e.g. historical weight measurements recorded by HCP).

For that:
- The patient has a [policy](policy-03.ttl) allows a subset of her health data to be read for primary care.
- The physician issues a [request](request-03.ttl) to read a subset of health data for primary care with consent as legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark. 

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

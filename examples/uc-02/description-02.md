# Use Case Description

Access by physician as data controller to specific subset of data with a known URI (e.g. historical weight measurements recorded by HCP).

For that:
- The patient has a [policy](policy-02.ttl) allows a subset of her health data to be read for primary care.
- The physician issues a [request](request-02.ttl) to read a subset of health data for primary care with consent as legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement, i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated 

### Subject/holder policy

- Data subject: <https://example.org/patient>
- Data/Personal data: <https://example.org/weight-by-hcp>
- Processing operation: `odrl:read`
- Purpose: `sector-health:PrimaryCareManagement`
- Pseudo/Anonymisation as a duty: N/A
- Recipient: N/A
- Duration: N/A
- Frequency: N/A
- Retrospective/prospective data: Retrospective -- TODO

### Request

- Data subject (type): <https://example.org/patient>
- Data/Personal data: <https://example.org/weight-by-hcp>
- Personal electronic health data: TODO-EHDS
- Non-personal electronic health data: TODO-EHDS
- Processing operation: : `odrl:read`
- Purpose: `sector-health:PrimaryCareManagement`
- Primary/Secondary use: Primary -- still needs to be expressed in the policy though
- Legal basis: `eu-gdpr:A9-2-a`
- Pseudo/Anonymisation as a duty: N/A
- Recipient: N/A
- Data source: N/A
- Duration: N/A
- Frequency: N/A
- Events/Activities: N/A

## Open Issues

Currently, it is theoretically the same as UC-01.
To differentiate it, we can have as the target data https://w3id.org/dpv/pd#Weight

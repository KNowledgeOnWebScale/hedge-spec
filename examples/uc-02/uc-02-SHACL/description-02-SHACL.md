# Use Case Description

Access by physician to specific subset of data (e.g. historical weight measurements recorded by HCP). Using a SHACL query.

For that:
- The patient has a [policy](policy-02-SHACL.ttl) allows a subset of her health data to be read for primary care.
- The physician issues a [request](request-02-SHACL.ttl) to read a subset of health data for primary care with consent as legal basis.

TODO: The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

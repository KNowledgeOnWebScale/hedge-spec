# Use Case Description

Access by FAQIR Pod Management Service, non-profit organization, to manage the patient's Pod. Full control.

For that:
- The user has a [policy](policy-22.ttl) that allows his pod to be managed by FAQIR Management Service.
- FAQIR issues a [request](request-22.ttl) to manage the pod without time limit and with consent as legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

## Issues
### Open Issues

1. Can `dpv:AccountManagement` be processing operation or it can only be a purpose?

If it cant, are `dpv:Processing` and `odrl:use` enough to represent "full control" over the pod?

2. Is Data Source not applicable or is it FAQIR?

# Use Case Description

Continuous data sharing with physician as data controller for primary use without a time restriction, enabling remote monitoring beyond direct one on one encounters.

For that:
- The patient has a [policy](policy-06.ttl) that allows personal health data to be read for primary care and remote monitoring without a time restriction.
- The physician issues a [request](request-06.ttl) to read health data for primary care or remote monitoring with consent as the legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

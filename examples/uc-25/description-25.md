# Use Case Description

Read and Write access by MoveUp Service over Patient Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor slices. 

For that:
- The user has a [policy](policy-25.ttl) that allows his Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor slices to be read and written by MoveUp's Servoce as Data Controller.
- MoveUp's Service issues a [request](request-25.ttl) to read and write on the patient's pod Profile, Questionnaire, and Sensor slices without time limit and with consent as legal basis.

TODO: SOTW & The expected agreement , i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated

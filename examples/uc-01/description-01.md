# Use Case Description

Access by physician as data controller to patient's full medical history during one on one consultation.

For that:
- The patient has a [policy](policy-01.ttl) allows her health data to be read for primary care.
- The physician issues a [request](request-01.ttl) to read health data for primary care with consent as the legal basis.

TODO: The expected agreement, i.e., generated by matching policy and request, should also be part of this benchmark.

## Use Case Requirements:

- N/A - non applicable requirements
- TODO - we still need to think about how to integrate that into an ODRL policy
- TODO-EHDS - required to assess whether EHDS is applicable, still needs to be incorporated
